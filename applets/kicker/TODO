External bugs:

* Sidebar DND behaves strangely and doesn't work for the system
  action favorites due to coordinate mapping bugs in Plasma's DND
  event class.

Internal todo:

* Exactly when the menu should stay open or close still has some
  loose ends vs. Plasma 1 version (needs more complex management
  for hideOnWindowDeactivate). Behavior very close to QMenu is the
  goal.

* Being able to type into the search field from any subdialog is
  desired but currently broken (see FIXME in ItemListView).

* Alpha fadeout for favorites overflow is TBD because OpacityMask
  doesn't easily work against IconItem.
