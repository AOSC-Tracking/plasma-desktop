External bugs:

* Initial size from panel when in a corner is slightly wrong due
  to a bug in Plasma's Dialog class causing it not to budget for
  the disabled border correctly.

* Sidebar DND behaves strangely and doesn't work for the system
  action favorites due to coordinate mapping bugs in Plasma's DND
  event class.

* Subdialog open performance is pretty poor right now, with in par-
  ticular the delegate icons coming with a visible delay. Needs a
  look for bottlenecks in the lib / research into workarounds.


Internal todo:

* Exactly when the menu should stay open or close still has some
  loose ends vs. Plasma 1 version (needs more complex management
  for hideOnWindowDeactivate). Behavior very close to QMenu is the
  goal.

* Being able to type into the search field from any subdialog is
  desired but currently broken (see FIXME in ItemListView).

* Keyboard nav between runner matches columns is commented out
  right now due to WIP-ness.

* Alpha fadeout for favorites overflow is TBD because OpacityMask
  doesn't easily work against IconItem.

* There's a rare crasher in runner support with a mile-long BT
  deep in V4 that needs wrangling.

* Reacting to (panel) location changes _at runtime_ doesn't work
  very well atm (needs a fix similar to 30cedd69 in taskmanager).
